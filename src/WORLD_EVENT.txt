We decided to make a wildfire that starts with a singular tile
on fire where the mouse is clicked. As time goes on, the fire spreads to
other points and effects at most 7 tiles. If dude comes into contact with the fire,
it transforms into DudeOnFire which is dude with fire on him. This DudeOnFire goes to the
nearest water which is class obstacle. Once DudeOnFire gets to the water, it transforms back to
DudeFull which means it goes back to the house. One exception is that if the entity clicked is dude,
instead of starting a fire it just makes that Dude to transform to DudeOnFire. Lastly, once the
dude is on fire, it avoids the fire to get to the water.
